Welcome to Sniff and Play. This app manages related data through complex forms and RESTful routes. The goal of the application is to build a Content Management System. 

This app uses the Ruby on Rails framework. My models include at least one has_many, belongs_to and two has_many :through relationshionships. I incorporated validations into my models to defend against invalid data. I also provided standard user authentication, including sighnup, login, logout, and passwords in my app.
